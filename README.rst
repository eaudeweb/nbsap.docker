Project name and whereabouts
----------------------------
The project name is National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plan (or simply NBSAP).
It is a platform for organizing the implementation of a country's
national biodiversity strategy after AICHI (and by case after EU Strategy).
It consists of two panels each corresponding an operation: viewing and editing.
The first panel allows anyone to overview the aichi goals, targets and
indicators along with national strategy mappings (the way a country develops its
own strategy in terms of objectives and actions) and its implementation.
The second panel(Admin), authentication-available only, allows an user to actually define
the national strategy. (e.g. add/modify/delete an objective, action or even
elements from AICHI) in the purpose of building it.


Prerequisites
-------------

* Install `Docker <https://docker.com>`_
* Install `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose>`_
* Install `Apache <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-centos-6#step-one—install-apache>`_

Usage in production
-------------------

1. Clone the repository::

    $ git https://github.com/eaudeweb/nbsap.docker.git
    $ cd nbsap.docker
   
2. Start application stack::

    $ docker-compose up -d

3. Verify that all containers are up (check ``State`` column)::

    $ docker-compose ps

4. Wait until the migrations are done. You can see the migrations status using::

    $ docker logs -f nbsapdocker_$INSTANCE_NAME_1

5. After the migrations are done, you can see your instance in action at::

    http://localhost:$INSTANCE_PORT


Where ``$INSTANCE_PORT`` is one of the following:

* 8002 for Benin
* 8004 for Burundi
* 8010 for Maroc
* 8011 for Niger
* 8013 for Training

6. Restore a mysql database::

    $ cat backup.sql | docker exec -i nbsapdocker_mysql_1 /usr/bin/mysql -u root --password=$PASSWORD DATABASE

You should replace ``$PASSWORD`` with the password set in ``mysql.env``, ``DATABASE`` with the ``DATABASES_NAME`` set in the instance coresponding env file and ``backup.sql`` with the name of the .sql file containing your data dump.

7. Add conf file::

    $ cp conf-files/nbsap.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/nbsap.conf

8. If something does not work as you expect, check the logs::

    $ docker logs -f nbsapdocker_$INSTANCE_NAME_1

You can open a new issue `here <https://github.com/eaudeweb/nbsap.docker/issues>`_. You should put in the new issue the errors and the logs.

9. For development follow these `steps <https://github.com/eea/eea.docker.tct/tree/master#run-in-devel-with-docker-compose>`_.

Upgrade
-------

1. Get the latest source code::

3. Restart application stack::

    $ docker-compose up -d

4. Check that everything is up-and-running::

   $ docker-compose ps
