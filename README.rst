Project name and whereabouts
----------------------------
The project name is National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plan (or simply NBSAP).
It is a platform for organizing the implementation of a country's
national biodiversity strategy after AICHI (and by case after EU Strategy).
It consists of two panels each corresponding an operation: viewing and editing.
The first panel allows anyone to overview the aichi goals, targets and
indicators along with national strategy mappings (the way a country develops its
own strategy in terms of objectives and actions) and its implementation.
The second panel(Admin), authentication-available only, allows an user to actually define
the national strategy. (e.g. add/modify/delete an objective, action or even
elements from AICHI) in the purpose of building it.


Run in devel with Docker Compose
--------------------------------

**Create and edit the following files**::

Edit *mysql.env*::

  $ cp env-files/mysql.env.example env-files/mysql.env
  $ vim env-files/mysql.env

Edit *demo.env*. You can change the environment variables to suit your needs. In *demo.env.example* file you can see an example of how this variables should look like::

  $ cp env-files/demo.env.example env-files/demo.env
  $ vim env-files/demo.env

**Start the containers**::

  $ docker-compose up -d

**Copy apache.conf file to the Apache container**::

    $ docker cp conf-files/apache.conf tct_apache_1:/usr/local/apache2/conf/extra/vh-my-app.conf
    $ docker-compose restart apache


Common configuration
--------------------

Set *ALLOWED_USERS* in settings to restrict access to a specific set of usernames.

See *settings.py* for LDAP Authentication configuration.


=================
Translation files
=================
For translations there are two methods.

1. Manual translation

Run over the entire source tree and pull out all strings marked for translation::

  $ docker exec -it tct_demo_1 bash
  $ cd tct
  $ django-admin.py makemessages -a

Edit <msgstr> for each <msgid> in tct/locale/_LANGUAGE_/LC_MESSAGE/django.po

Compile .po file created with previous command::

  $ django-admin.py compilemessages

Restart server::

  $ docker-compose restart demo

2. Automatic translation

Enter the application container::

  $ docker exec -it tct_demo_1 bash

Create a superuser::

  $ ./manage.py createsuperuser
  # surf over /translate to use Rosetta tool for translation
  # complete the forms within the correct translations
  # restart server when ready
  $ docker-compose restart demo
